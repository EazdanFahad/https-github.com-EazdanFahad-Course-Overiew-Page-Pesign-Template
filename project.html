	<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>When a student accesses a course they are enrolled in, the first page they see is a course overview page. <br>This page provides an outline of the course curriculum and indicates the current course progress of the <br>student. It also lists some basic course details, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The course author and bio</li>

	<li>Included courses (only applicable if the course is part of a bundle)</li>

	<li> <b>Course Certificate</b> tab (only applicable if a student has fully completed a course with an active certificate)</li>

	<li style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Course access duration (only applicable if the course has a set time limit on course access)</li>

</ul>

	<p>There are three available options for course design templates: <b> Teachable Classic, Colossal,</b> or <b> Simple.</b> All <br> are supported in web and mobile browsers. Primary owners, owners, and course authors are able<br>  to edit course design templates.</p>

<p> <b>Teachable Classic </b> is best for creators who want to dive right into lecture creation. The course curriculum is <br> focused as the main feature on the page, with a left-side menu containing tabs for an author bio, bundled<br> courses, and a course certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">
	
</style>The <b> Simple</b> template, best suited for shorter curriculums, provides a clean, simplified viewing experience.<br> Curriculum, author, and bundle information is tabbed along the top of the page, allowing students to easily <br> navigate course details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px;"> The <b> Colossal</b> template, best suited for longer curriculums, includes a robust view that showcases your <br>curriculum, course information and the author bio all on the same page. Your course image is featured at the<br> top of the page, along with a button allowing students to jump right back into the curriculum from where they<br> left off. </p>
<h1>Preview and activate templates</h1>

<img src="sitethemecoursedesignupdate.png" alt="">

<p>Some key categories from the<b> Color Palette</b> menu that affect your course design template include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Buttons & Links -</b> will update the various start buttons and curriculum menu icons</li>
	<li><b>Nav Bar & Footer Background -</b> will update the color of the navigation bar at the top of the page</li>
</ul>



</div>

<p class="p21"><b>NOTE:</b> The<b> Body Text</b> or<b> Headings</b> sections from<b> Site > Theme > Colors </b> will not impact the color of text on the<b> Simple<br></b> and<b> Colossal</b> design templates. On these templates, all body text and heading text is black at this time.
</p>

<div class="p11">
	<h3>Images</h3>

	<p>The main image on each course design template is the<b> Course Image.</b> You can update the course image from the course<b> Information</b> page in the Branding section.</p>

	<p style="margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 30px;">We recommend the following image specifications for the course image:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Format: JPG, PNG</li>
		<li>Aspect ratio: 16:9</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note that if using the<b> Simple</b> template, the height of the course image is shorter than in other<br> templates. Therefore, we recommend using an image without a specific focal point (i.e., images without text<br> or subjects) for best results.</p>

	<p>An author bio image is also included in the author bio section, or tab, of the course design template. The<br> author bio image can be updated from the<b> Author</b> tab of the specific author’s<b> User</b> profile. Alternatively, you<br> can update the image for the bio from the<b> Site > Bios</b> page.</p>

	<p>We recommend the following image specifications for the author bio image:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Format: JPG, PNG</li>
		<li>Size: 250x250 px</li>
	</ul>
